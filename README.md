## Consumer Experience Prediction

The most important asset of a Business is its customers. Customers are the best source of feedback. They use the service or product and then they share their feedback hence it is necessary to monitor if the feedback is positive or negative. We can use their comments and insights into improvements for products and services. Closing the customer feedback loop is making sure you have addressed the feedback, and resolving the issue of acknowledging the positive opinion that your customers have shared. This helps us to create a customer-centric culture of action, where the Business gathers customer feedback and turns it into actionable insights.

Steps taken during the feedback loop might be:

1) Sharing an appropriate response with the customer depending if the feedback is positive feedback or negative feedback.
2) If the number of positive responses is more then a system could be devised to automate the positive responses.
3) If we can automate the response to simple issues or queries then it gives employees time to spend on priority issues.
4) The internal process could be improved according to the feedback received in the internal response.

### Business Requirement

_**Basic Flow:**_
- The business collects and analyzes customer feedback using a sentiment analysis tool that assigns a positive, or negative score to each feedback.
- The business uses the sentiment scores to calculate the overall customer satisfaction and loyalty metrics, such as Net Promoter Score (NPS), Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT), or Customer Effort Score (CES).
- The business identifies the key drivers of customer satisfaction and loyalty, such as product quality, service delivery, pricing, or support.
- The business uses the insights from the sentiment analysis and the customer satisfaction and loyalty metrics to improve the customer experience, such as by resolving issues, enhancing features, offering discounts, or rewarding loyal customers.
  
**Postconditions:** Customer receives a better customer experience and is more likely to repurchase, recommend, or advocate for the business.
**Exceptions:** Customer feedback is incomplete, inaccurate, or irrelevant. The sentiment analysis tool fails to capture the true emotion or intention of the customer. Customer satisfaction and loyalty metrics are not aligned with the business goals or customer expectations.
