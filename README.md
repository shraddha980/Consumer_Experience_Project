## Consumer Experience Prediction

A customer feedback loop is the process of getting feedback from the customer and responding to that feedback. Depending on the type of feedback we receive, it could be either a positive feedback loop or negative feedback loop.

**Basic Flow:**
- The business collects and analyzes the customer feedback using a sentiment analysis tool that assigns a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment score to each feedback.
- The business uses the sentiment scores to calculate the overall customer satisfaction and loyalty metrics, such as Net Promoter Score (NPS), Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT), or Customer Effort Score (CES).
- The business identifies the key drivers of customer satisfaction and loyalty, such as product quality, service delivery, pricing, or support.
- The business uses the insights from the sentiment analysis and the customer satisfaction and loyalty metrics to improve the customer experience, such as by resolving issues, enhancing features, offering discounts, or rewarding loyal customers.
**Postconditions:** Customer receives a better customer experience and is more likely to repurchase, recommend, or advocate for the business.
**Exceptions:** Customer feedback is incomplete, inaccurate, or irrelevant. Sentiment analysis tool fails to capture the true emotion or intention of the customer. Customer satisfaction and loyalty metrics are not aligned with the business goals or customer expectations.
